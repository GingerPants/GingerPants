      I just graduated from university and got a <b>Bechelor Engineering in Computer Enginerring</b>.
      The job position that I am seeking is a <b>Software Developer</b>.<br>
      I have studied and worked in different fields in various countries in the past. From that experience, I learned things like how to communicate with people, how to respect different cultures, and how to have a working mindset.<br>
      I wanted to learn computer programming as a hobby in the beginning. After that, I wanted to learn more in earnst So I went to university and I enjoyed my studies throughout my university years, and it was so fun. And I was able to graduate with good grades.<br>
      My strength is that I like all computer-related things, I am curious and learn quickly.<br>
      My downside seems to be my career in other fields in the past.<br>
      I will try to be more helpful and want to be recognized for my efforts without wasting my talent.<br>
